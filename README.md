## 🔧 Getting Started

###  Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nahidn228/note-app-with-mongoose.git
cd note-app-with-mongoose


## 🧠 Why These Tools?
- TypeScript helps avoid runtime errors and makes the code easier to maintain.
- Mongoose gives control over MongoDB with schemas and validation.
- Zod adds another layer of input validation — before hitting the database — making the API more secure and error-resistant.
- MVC pattern helps keep the codebase clean and scalable.
